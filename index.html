   <p>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Arabian Peninsula. It occupies an area about the size of the United States east of the Mississippi River. Saudi Arabia’s population is 27 million, including 8.4 million foreign residents (2010 census),  and its capital city is Riyadh.</p>
   <hr>
   <p>Saudi Arabia’s geography is diverse, with forests, grasslands, mountain ranges and deserts. The climate varies from region to region. Temperatures can reach over 110 degrees Fahrenheit in the desert in the summer, while in the winter temperatures in the north and central parts of the country can drop below freezing. Saudi Arabia gets very little rain, only about four inches a year on average.</p>

    <P><strong> Saudi Arabia,<sup>[e]</sup>  officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia </strong><sub>(KSA)</sub>,[f] is a country in the <em>Middle East</em>. 
        It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula and has a land area of about 2150000 km<sup>2</sup> (830000 sq mi),
         making it the fifth-largest country in <span style="border: 1px solid black">Asia</span> and the largest in the Middle East. It is bordered by 
         the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United
          Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country 
          off its east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt and Israel. 
          Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most
           of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains.
         Saudi Arabia's capital and largest city is Riyadh; the kingdom is also the location of Islam's two holiest cities of Mecca and Medina.</P>

    <P><strong>Pre-Islamic Arabia</strong>, the territory that constitutes modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory
         of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity outside Africa.<sub>[17]</sub> The world's second-largest religion,<sup>[18]</sup> Islam, emerged in
          what is now Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century, the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of the Arabian Peninsula and created a 
          single <em>Islamic religious polity</em>..[19] Following his death in 632, his followers expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, 
          conquering territories in North Africa, parts of Central and South Asia and parts of Iberia[citation needed] in a matter of decades.
          [20][21][22] Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517),
           and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, as well as numerous other dynasties in <span style="border: 1px solid black">Asia, Africa, and Europe</span>.</P>

    <P>Following the amalgamation of the <strong>Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd</strong>, the new state was named al-Mamlaka al-ʿArabiyya as-Suʿūdiyya 
        <em>(a transliteration of المملكة العربية السعودية in Arabic)</em>by royal decree on <sup>23</sup> September <sub>1932</sub> by its founder, Abdulaziz bin Saud.
         Although this is normally translated as "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia" in English,[47] it literally means <span style="border: 1px solid black">"the Saudi Arab kingdom"</span>,[48] 
         or "the Arab Saudi Kingdom".[49]</P>

    <P>There is evidence that human habitation in the Arabian Peninsula dates back to about <strong>125000 years ago</strong>.[54] A 2011 study found that the first modern humans to spread east
         across <em>Asia left Africa about 75000 years ago across the Bab-el-Mandeb connecting the Horn of Africa and Arabia.</em><sup>[55]</sup> The Arabian Peninsula is regarded as central
          to the understanding of evolution and dispersals of Man. Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the Quaternary that led to profound evolutionary
           and <span style="border: 1px solid black">demographic changes</span>. Arabia has a rich Lower Paleolithic record, and the quantity of Oldowan-like sites in the region indicate a significant role that Arabia
            had played in the early hominin colonization of Eurasia.<sub>[56]</sub></P>
            
    <P><strong>The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly</strong> consisted of mainly four distinct historical <span style="border: 1px solid black">regions: Hejaz, Najd,</span> and parts of <em>Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and South Arabia
         ('Asir).</em><sup>[23]</sup>The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in <sub>1932</sub> by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West). He united the four regions into a single state through 
         a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy,
          where political decisions are made on the basis of consultation among the King, the Council of Ministers, and the country's traditional elites that oversee a highly 
          authoritarian regime.[24][25][26]</P>
